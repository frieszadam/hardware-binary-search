# Hardware Binary Search Implementation

This design uses a controller datapath split enabled by the "Algorithmic State Machine Datapath" (ASMD) modeling technique to implement the binary search algorithm via specialized hardware on an FPGA. Special attention is paid to edge cases and wrapping the design for upload to physical FPGA development board. This approach vastly improves computational efficiency when compared to a traditional CPU powered alternative.

Verification is present in accompanying functional-verification.pdf generated by the comprehensive bs_tb testbench module and the ModelSim simulation environment.
